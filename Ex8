Given a string s, return a string where all occurences of its first char have been changed to '*', except do not change the first char itself.

e.g. 'babble' yields 'ba**le'

Assume that the string is length 1 or more. Hint: s.replace(stra, strb) returns a version of string s where all instances of stra have been replaced by strb.
